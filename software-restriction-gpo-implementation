SOFTWARE RESTRICTION GROUP POLICY IMPLEMENTATION

This group policy was created to prevent any executables from executing in the %AppData% or %LocalAppData%; this was to prevent CryptoWall and its variants from executing in these know execution folders. See This CryptoWall/Ransomware article for more information.
Implementation

I created a Group Policy Object . In this GPO, I created policies under, Computer Configuration > Policies>Windows Settings>Software Restriction Policies>Additional Rules that restrict the most common areas where ransomware may try to execute; any rules that are “unrestricted” are executables that are whitelisted to run so a program can work properly such as Slack. The rules I created are: 

Block CryptoWall executable in %AppData%
Path: %AppData%\*.exe 
Security Level: Disallowed
Description: Don't allow executables to run from %AppData%.

Block CryptoWall executable in %LocalAppData%
Path if using Windows XP: %UserProfile%\Local Settings\*.exe
Path if using Windows Vista/7/8: %LocalAppData%\*.exe
Security Level: Disallowed
Description: Don't allow executables to run from %AppData%.

Block Zbot executable in %AppData%
Path: %AppData%\*\*.exe 
Security Level: Disallowed
Description: Don't allow executables to run from immediate subfolders of %AppData%.

Block Zbot executable in %LocalAppData%
Path if using Windows XP: %UserProfile%\Local Settings\*\*.exe
Path if using Windows Vista/7/8: %LocalAppData%\*\*.exe
Security Level: Disallowed
Description: Don't allow executables to run from immediate subfolders of %AppData%.

Block executables run from archive attachments opened with WinRAR:
Path if using Windows XP: %UserProfile%\Local Settings\Temp\Rar*\*.exe
Path if using Windows Vista/7/8: %LocalAppData%\Temp\Rar*\*.exe
Security Level: Disallowed
Description: Block executables run from archive attachments opened with WinRAR.

Block executables run from archive attachments opened with 7zip:
Path if using Windows XP: %UserProfile%\Local Settings\Temp\7z*\*.exe
Path if using Windows Vista/7/8: %LocalAppData%\Temp\7z*\*.exe
Security Level: Disallowed
Description: Block executables run from archive attachments opened with 7zip.

Block executables run from archive attachments opened with WinZip:
Path if using Windows XP: %UserProfile%\Local Settings\Temp\wz*\*.exe
Path if using Windows Vista/7/8: %LocalAppData%\Temp\wz*\*.exe
Security Level: Disallowed
Description: Block executables run from archive attachments opened with WinZip.

Block executables run from archive attachments opened using Windows built-in Zip support:
Path if using Windows XP: %UserProfile%\Local Settings\Temp\*.zip\*.exe
Path if using Windows Vista/7/8: %LocalAppData%\Temp\*.zip\*.exe
Security Level: Disallowed
Description: Block executables run from archive attachments opened using Windows built-in Zip support.


Allowing An Executable Through Software Restriction Policy 

If a program isn't executing or gives a "Program is blocked by Group Policy", you can easily find the cause by opening the Event Viewer for that computer and flitering out event ID 866; copy the path of the blocked executable after "/AppData/" or "/AppData/Local/ .  On a domain controller, Open Group Policy Management then right-click>edit the Software restriction group policy you created. Under Computer Configuration > Policies>Windows Settings>Security Settings>Software Restriction Policies>Additional Rules, right click in the whitespace and choose “New Path Rule..”.  In  the “Path” textbox type %LocalAppData%, paste the path that you copied previously, then change the security level to unrestricted; use the other SRP entries as a guide. Make sure you write a detailed note in the description on why the path rule was created, as well as document in the IT Change Logs.
